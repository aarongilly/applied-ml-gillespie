# Purpose

This code base is being created in the course of completing module 2 of CSIS 44-670 from NW Missouri University. This `README.md` accompanies a Jupyter Notebook in which we will analyze data representing the passengers from the RMS Titanic, which sank in a very famous James Cameron movie (also real life). We are utilizing this dataset to, which [some research suggests](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-titanic-data-eda-using-seaborn/) is a commonly utilized dataset for getting started with Machine Learning. In essence, this is the `hello world!` of my advnetures with machine learning. 

For more detail see the the Jupyter Notebook `ml02_gillespie.ipynb`, which contains comments throughout that explain the code and its objectives.
